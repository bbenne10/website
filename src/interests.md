# My interests

In typical ADHD nerd fashion, I'm into a lot of varied things.
I'd love to chat your ear off about them if you've got the patience.

## ðŸ“š Fantasy and Science Fiction Novels
### ðŸ§™ Fantasy

Unsurprisingly, I'm a big Brandon Sanderson fan.
Almost everyone into fantasy novels these days is too - 
and for good reason: The dude is a master of world building.

Other fantasy authors I am or have been into over the years include:

* Brian Staveley
* China Mieville
* Raymond E. Feist
* Robin Hobb
* Scott Lynch
* Terry Brooks
* Terry Goodkind (though his political views and treatment of women got...old)

You may note some glaring omissions.
I simply haven't read enough of 
Neil Gaiman, Robert Jordan, Patrick Rothfuss etc. 
to have too much of an opinion.

### ðŸ¤– Science Fiction

I like a fair amount of science fiction too,
though I am significantly pickier with it than fantasy.

Some authors I have enjoyed:

* Aldous Huxley
* Emily St. John Mandel (particularly Station Eleven - largely unfamiliar with her other works)
* Hannu Rajaniemi
* Kurt Vonnegut (though his position as a "sci-fi writer" is a bit tenuous)
* Neal Stephenson
* Orson Scott Card 
* Phillip K. Dick
* Ray Bradbury


## ðŸŽµ Music

In short: I like just about everything.
I mean that.
From country to death metal with a trip towards electronic and jazz thrown in,
I like a LOT of music. 

I think that what I enjoy isn't a genre,
but tailored artistic expression.
I don't care for much of the "unbridled" music.
Not much into punk or noise - 
the "rawness" of it doesn't strike a chord for me (no pun intended).
But the combination of emotion with strong theory foundations? 
I love that.

Artists I particularly I love (ordered as they come to me while writing):

* Cynic's brand of progressive metal-jazz
* Coltrane's late-career output
* [Emancipator][], [general fuzz][], [burial][]
* Tyler Childers, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell
* [Allegaeon][], [Slugdge][], [Ulcerate][]
* [Eidola][], [Royal Coda][],

## â›º Hiking & Camping
 
I do not do nearly enough of this these days, 
but I really enjoy overnighting. 

I have not had an opportunity,
but am very excited at the prospect of backcountry camping 
with long hike-ins and minimal gear.

Happy to chat about this,
but I am not a gear nerd so discussions get wishy-washy rather quickly.
