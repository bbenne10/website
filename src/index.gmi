# A Foray into Space ðŸš€
## Who am I?
Bryan Bennett, as you know. You made it to this domain after all.
My pronouns are he/him/his.
I'm a software developer. I work for GTRI doing a lot of different things. Mostly, I write web services and pretend to be a "software architect".
Sometimes, I get to play around with cooler things, like formal verification, software-assurance, functional languages, etc.
I live in Atlanta with a small family. I try to get outdoors by myself when I can.
I'm a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a social music fraternity. In non-pandemic times, I happen to be the President of the Atlanta-area Alumni Association.
Basically, I'm just a dad who likes loud music, has strong opinions about computers, and enjoys sitting in the woods.

## What is this?

For now, you can find me in the places linked below.
