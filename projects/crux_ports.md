# Crux ports

###Ports for Crux (Seriously. What did you expect?)

These ports are meant to provide packages for pieces of software that I find
particularly useful. Either I have made small changes to these ports (in the
case of at least acpi and weechat), ported an Arch PKGBUILD, or built the whole
port from scratch. That is to say - these aren't entirely my work, but they are
"my version".

####Download

These ports are indexed via their [Github page](http://github.com/bbenne10/crux_ports).

####Status

These ports should be mostly stable. They're probaly out of date, however. If
you find any problems, please [contact me](../contacts.html) or open an
issue on Github.

####Available ports

    * acpi
    * gbdfed
    * gvim
    * slmenu
    * The Silver Searcher (or Ag)
    * vim
    * vimb
